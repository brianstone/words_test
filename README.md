#words_test
By Brian Stone

##What is word_test?
A program used to solve the following problem:
Write a program which, given a dictionary, generates two output files, 'sequences' and 'words'. 'sequences' should contain every sequence of four letters (A-z) that appears in exactly one word of the dictionary, one sequence per line. 'words' should contain the corresponding words that contain the sequences, in the same order, again one per line.

###Requirements:
1. Ruby 2.0+ installed

###Getting Started
1. Clone `words_test`
2. Run `ruby word_program.rb`
3. Pass in `dictionary.txt`
4. View created files

###Additional Files
`dictionary.txt`
Contains a large number of words and should be used to achieve the final solution.

`test_dict.txt`
Contains a small number of words used for testing on a smaller scale.

`word_program_test.rb`
Contains similar code as word_program.rb, but includes small tests for clarification. Can be run seperately if needed.

`sequences`
Sequences is created after word_test is finished running and contains the desired 4 letter sequences.

`words`
Words is created after word_test is finished running and contains the words corresponding to each 4 letter sequence.
